# TrajSim2D
TrajSim2D is a 2D testbed for trajectory algorithms of planar robot manipulators with N-DoF revolute joints, running in ROS 2. It generates random obstacle-rich environments, publishes joint states, base wrenches, obstacle point clouds, and costmaps, and supports trajectory testing, collision-free pose sampling, and visualisation.
